## About The Project

The traditional method of handling lost items at AAU is often informal and unreliable, leading to frustration and permanent loss of property. This project introduces a structured and efficient digital solution. Built with a user-centered design approach, the system allows students and staff to manage lost and found items transparently, fostering a stronger sense of community and responsibility.

## Key Features

- **Seamless Item Reporting:** Users can easily submit detailed reports for both lost and found items, including categories, descriptions, locations, and photo uploads.
- **Advanced Search & Filtering:** Quickly find items using keywords, categories, and location filters.
- **Secure Claim Process:** A private verification system ensures items are returned to their rightful owners by allowing finders to request non-public details before revealing contact info.
- **Moderator-Focused Admin Role:** Admins can moderate and resolve disputes without editing user-generated content, preserving post integrity.
- **Accountability Log:** Tracks when an item is successfully returned, recording claimant info (submitted by the finder) for accountability.
- **Responsive Design:** Designed in Figma with a mobile-first approach, ensuring functionality on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript
- **Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS):** Supabase
- **Database:** Supabase DB (PostgreSQL)
- **Authentication:** Supabase Auth
- **Design:** Figma

## Project Development Insights
